# AGENT_FLOW.md  development contract

This file defines the deterministic workflow the orchestrator agent must follow. It is designed for "fresh context" Ralph-style loops: each cycle starts with no conversational memory and must re-derive state from repo files.

## 0) Inputs and sources of truth

At the start of every cycle, read:
- /CLAUDE.md
- /agent/PRD.md
- /agent/backlog.yaml
- /agent/TEST_PRACTICES.md
- /agent/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md
- /CHANGELOG.md

Rules:
- /agent/backlog.yaml is the only source of "what to do next".
- /agent/backlog.yaml and /agent/QUESTIONS.md are the only files in /agent that the agent should modify. The user is responsible for edits to the other files. If you would like to suggest an edit to these files, do so in /agent/IDEAS.md or /agent/QUESTIONS.md
- /agent/PRD.md defines product requirements and scope.
- /agent/TEST_PRACTICES.md and /agent/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md define standards.

If two docs conflict:
1) PRD overrides other non-process docs
2) TEST/DEVELOPMENT practices override convenience
3) CLAUDE.md overrides everything for safety rules
4) AGENT_FLOW.md governs process

## 1) Story lifecycle

Each story in backlog.yaml has a `status` field with one of these values:

- **todo** (default): Not started. Eligible for selection by the fullstack engineer.
- **in_progress**: Fullstack engineer is actively implementing.
- **review**: Implementation complete. Pending code review.
- **testing**: Code review passed. Pending QA testing.
- **done**: All gates passed. Story is complete.
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed. Must have a non-empty `blocked_reason`.

### 1.1 Status transitions

```
todo ──────────► in_progress ──────────► review ──────────► testing ──────────► done
                     ▲                     │                   │
                     │    (changes requested)                  │ (issues found)
                     └─────────────────────┘                   │
                     ▲                                         │
                     └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Any status ──► blocked (with blocked_reason)
blocked ──► todo (when blocker is resolved by user)
```

Valid transitions:
- `todo` → `in_progress`: Fullstack engineer picks up the story
- `in_progress` → `review`: Implementation and tests complete, ready for code review
- `in_progress` → `blocked`: Cannot continue without external input
- `review` → `testing`: Code review approved
- `review` → `in_progress`: Code review returned feedback (stored in `review_feedback`)
- `testing` → `done`: QA approved, all gates passed
- `testing` → `in_progress`: QA found issues (stored in `review_feedback`)

### 1.2 Story dependencies (`requires`)

A story may declare a `requires` field listing the IDs of stories that must be completed before it can be started. This is a structural dependency defined at planning time, distinct from the runtime `blocked` state.

- A story with `requires: [S-002, S-004]` is not eligible for selection until both S-002 and S-004 have `status: done`.
- `requires` dependencies are transitive in effect: if S-009 requires S-008, and S-008 requires S-007, then S-009 cannot start until both S-007 and S-008 are done.
- A story may be both `requires`-gated and `blocked` — these are independent conditions.

### 1.3 Review feedback

When a code reviewer or QA expert returns a story to `in_progress`, they record feedback in the `review_feedback` field of the story in backlog.yaml. This field is a free-text string describing what needs to change. The fullstack engineer reads this field when resuming work on the story and clears it when setting status to `review` again.

## 2) Subagents

The orchestrator delegates work to specialized subagents via the Task tool. Subagent definitions live in `/.claude/agents/`:

| Subagent | File | Invoked when | Sets status to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fullstack Engineer | `fullstack-engineer.md` | Story is `todo` or `in_progress` | `review` |
| Code Reviewer | `code-reviewer.md` | Story is `review` | `testing` or `in_progress` |
| QA Expert | `qa-expert.md` | Story is `testing` | `done` or `in_progress` |
| Debugger | `debugger.md` | On demand (test failures, hard bugs) | n/a |
| Security Auditor | `security-auditor.md` | On demand (security-sensitive stories) | n/a |

### 2.1 Invoking subagents

Use the Task tool to invoke a subagent. Pass the subagent's prompt (from its `.md` file) along with the story context (ID, acceptance criteria, branch name, and any review feedback). The subagent works within the current repository state and returns a structured result.

### 2.2 Subagent model selection

- **Fullstack Engineer**: Use `sonnet` model for implementation speed
- **Code Reviewer**: Use `opus` model for thorough review
- **QA Expert**: Use `sonnet` model for test execution
- **Debugger**: Use `sonnet` model for diagnosis
- **Security Auditor**: Use `opus` model for thorough analysis

## 3) Selecting work

The orchestrator must process stories in this priority order:

### 3.1 Priority: finish in-flight work first

1. **Review queue**: Find stories with `status: review`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the code reviewer.
2. **Testing queue**: Find stories with `status: testing`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the QA expert.
3. **In-progress stories with feedback**: Find stories with `status: in_progress` AND a non-empty `review_feedback`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the fullstack engineer to address the feedback.
4. **New work**: Select a new story using the algorithm below.

### 3.2 New work selection algorithm (deterministic)

1) Filter stories with `status: todo`.
2) Exclude stories that are `blocked` (blocked=true or blocked_reason present).
3) Exclude stories whose `requires` list contains any story that does not have `status: done`.
4) Choose the highest priority story (higher number = higher priority unless backlog schema states otherwise).
5) Tie-breaker: lowest id lexicographically.

If no eligible stories remain across all queues:
- Stop making changes and exit the cycle without modifying files.

## 4) Per-cycle workflow

The orchestrator performs these steps each cycle:

### 4.1 Feature Branch
- Work each story in its own feature branch (e.g. `S-123` for a story, `B-321` for a bug)
- If the story is already `in_progress`/`review`/`testing`, the branch should already exist — switch to it
- If a story becomes blocked, do not merge down the branch
- If the story reaches `done` and the user has approved it, merge the branch into `main` after committing

### 4.2 Check for requirements changes
- Inspect the git commit history (or working set) for changes to the /agent/PRD.md or answers provided in /agent/QUESTIONS.md

### 4.3 Dispatch to subagent

Based on the story's current status, invoke the appropriate subagent:

#### Story status: `todo` or `in_progress`
1. Set status to `in_progress` in backlog.yaml if currently `todo`
2. Invoke the **fullstack engineer** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Any `review_feedback` (if returning from review/QA)
   - Branch name
3. On success: set status to `review`, clear `review_feedback`
4. On failure/blocked: set status to `blocked` with `blocked_reason`

#### Story status: `review`
1. Invoke the **code reviewer** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Branch name (diff against main)
2. If approved: set status to `testing`
3. If changes requested: set status to `in_progress`, record feedback in `review_feedback`

#### Story status: `testing`
1. Invoke the **QA expert** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Branch name
   - Code reviewer's approval notes (if any)
2. If approved: set status to `done`
3. If issues found: set status to `in_progress`, record feedback in `review_feedback`

### 4.4 Update artifacts

After each subagent completes:
- Update /agent/backlog.yaml with the new status and any feedback
- Are there questions that could help decide next steps? Update /agent/QUESTIONS.md and trigger a discord notification via the MCP tool. Also indicate questions in the chat output.
- Update /agent/IDEAS.md with ideas for features that could enhance the application

### 4.5 Commit rules
Default: commit when a story reaches `done` and the user has reviewed the changes. Wait for review before committing.
- Create a single commit per story unless the story explicitly requires multiple commits.
- Commit message format:
    - `story(<id>): <title>`
- Do not add "Co-Authored-By" trailers or any other attribution lines to commit messages.
- The commit must include:
    - code changes
    - passing tests for primary acceptance criteria
    - backlog.yaml updates
    - changelog entry

## 5) Definition of Done (DoD)

A story may be set to `status: done` only if all are true:
1) All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
2) Required tests are present and meaningful.
3) All relevant test suites pass locally.
4) Lint/typecheck passes where applicable (per story scope).
5) /CHANGELOG.md updated with the story entry.
6) Code review passed (story went through `review` → `testing` transition).
7) QA testing passed (story went through `testing` → `done` transition).
8) Work committed with correct message format (unless story explicitly overrides).
9) No scope violations:
    - no generated code edits in internal/api/gen or **/mocks or inside node_modules or any other generated/external code
    - no unofficial workarounds for stubbed features
    - no secrets added to repo or logs

## 6) Blocking rules

A story is BLOCKED when:
- A required dependency is missing (e.g., unresolved design decision, missing schema detail) AND
- Progress cannot continue without inventing requirements or violating PRD.

When blocked:
- Set `status: blocked`.
- Record blocked_reason with:
    - what is blocked
    - why it is blocked
    - what decision/input is needed
- Update /agent/IDEAS.md with ideas for features that could enhance the application
- Update /agent/backlog.yaml if stories now require each other in a new way

## 7) Safety gates

At all times:
- Respect CLAUDE.md safe-command policy.
- Never log secrets.
- Never modify infra/deploy/security-sensitive files unless the story explicitly requires it.

## 8) Stopping conditions

End the cycle when any occurs:
- The selected story reaches `done` and is committed.
- The selected story becomes `blocked` and backlog.yaml is updated accordingly.
- No eligible stories remain across any queue.
- A hard failure prevents continuing safely (e.g., irreconcilable test failures); record a blocker note and stop.

## 9) Discord notifications

If the `send_discord_notification` MCP tool is available, use it to notify the user at these points:

- **Start story**: When starting a story, send a notification with a basic summary of the story being worked.
- **Input needed**: Before displaying a claude permission request, send a notification to discord to get my attention.
- **Implementation complete**: When the fullstack engineer finishes and the story moves to `review`. Include the story ID and brief summary.
- **Review complete**: When the code reviewer finishes. Include the outcome (approved or changes requested).
- **QA complete**: When the QA expert finishes. Include the outcome (approved or issues found).
- **Story done**: When a story reaches `done`. Include the story ID, title, and brief summary.
- **Story merged down**: If running in non-interactive mode, send another message when committing and merging down.
- **Story blocked**: When a story becomes BLOCKED (section 6). Include the story ID and the blocked reason.
- **Cycle ending with no work**: When no eligible stories remain (section 3). State that the backlog is empty or fully blocked.

Keep messages concise (1-3 sentences). Do not include secrets, file paths, or code in notifications. If the tool is unavailable or fails, continue normally — notifications are best-effort and must not block the workflow.

## 10) Ralph loop expectations

The agent must assume:
- Context is cleared between cycles.
- The only persisted state is the repository content and git history.
- Therefore, always re-read the input files in section 0 before acting.
- A single cycle may advance a story through multiple status transitions (e.g., `todo` → `in_progress` → `review` → `testing` → `done`) if all subagents complete successfully within the cycle.
