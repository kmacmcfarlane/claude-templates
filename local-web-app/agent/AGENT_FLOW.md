# AGENT_FLOW.md  development contract

This file defines the deterministic workflow the orchestrator agent must follow. It is designed for "fresh context" Ralph-style loops: each cycle starts with no conversational memory and must re-derive state from repo files.

## 0) Inputs and sources of truth

At the start of every cycle, read:
- /CLAUDE.md
- /agent/PRD.md
- /agent/backlog.yaml
- /agent/TEST_PRACTICES.md
- /agent/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md
- /CHANGELOG.md

Rules:
- /agent/backlog.yaml is the only source of "what to do next".
- /agent/backlog.yaml and /agent/QUESTIONS.md are the only files in /agent that the agent should modify. The user is responsible for edits to the other files. If you would like to suggest an edit to these files, do so in /agent/IDEAS.md or /agent/QUESTIONS.md
- /agent/PRD.md defines product requirements and scope.
- /agent/TEST_PRACTICES.md and /agent/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md define standards.

If two docs conflict:
1) PRD overrides other non-process docs
2) TEST/DEVELOPMENT practices override convenience
3) CLAUDE.md overrides everything for safety rules
4) AGENT_FLOW.md governs process

## 1) Story lifecycle

Each story in backlog.yaml has a `status` field with one of these values:

- **todo** (default): Not started. Eligible for selection by the fullstack engineer.
- **in_progress**: Fullstack engineer is actively implementing.
- **review**: Implementation complete. Pending code review.
- **testing**: Code review passed. Pending QA testing.
- **done**: All gates passed. Story is complete.
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed. Must have a non-empty `blocked_reason`.

### 1.1 Status transitions

```
todo ──────────► in_progress ──────────► review ──────────► testing ──────────► done
                     ▲                     │                   │
                     │    (changes requested)                  │ (issues found)
                     └─────────────────────┘                   │
                     ▲                                         │
                     └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Any status ──► blocked (with blocked_reason)
blocked ──► todo (when blocker is resolved by user)
```

Valid transitions — the **Deciding subagent** column shows which subagent's verdict triggers the transition. The **orchestrator** writes all status changes to backlog.yaml; subagents only report their verdict.

| Transition | Deciding subagent | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `todo` → `in_progress` | **Fullstack Engineer** | Picks up the story to begin implementation |
| `in_progress` → `review` | **Fullstack Engineer** | Implementation and tests complete |
| `in_progress` → `blocked` | **Fullstack Engineer** | Cannot continue without external input |
| `review` → `testing` | **Code Reviewer** | Code review approved |
| `review` → `in_progress` | **Code Reviewer** | Changes requested (feedback in `review_feedback`) |
| `testing` → `done` | **QA Expert** | QA approved, all gates passed |
| `testing` → `in_progress` | **QA Expert** | Issues found (feedback in `review_feedback`) |

**Ownership rules:**
- No subagent may write status changes directly to backlog.yaml. Subagents report structured verdicts; the orchestrator updates backlog.yaml.
- No subagent may update CHANGELOG, commit, or merge. These are exclusively orchestrator responsibilities (see section 4.5).
- The orchestrator enforces valid transitions by only invoking the correct subagent for the story's current status.

### 1.2 Story dependencies (`requires`)

A story may declare a `requires` field listing the IDs of stories that must be completed before it can be started. This is a structural dependency defined at planning time, distinct from the runtime `blocked` state.

- A story with `requires: [S-002, S-004]` is not eligible for selection until both S-002 and S-004 have `status: done`.
- `requires` dependencies are transitive in effect: if S-009 requires S-008, and S-008 requires S-007, then S-009 cannot start until both S-007 and S-008 are done.
- A story may be both `requires`-gated and `blocked` — these are independent conditions.

### 1.3 Review feedback

When a code reviewer or QA expert returns a story to `in_progress`, they record feedback in the `review_feedback` field of the story in backlog.yaml. This field is a free-text string describing what needs to change. The fullstack engineer reads this field when resuming work on the story and clears it when setting status to `review` again.

## 2) Subagents

The orchestrator delegates work to specialized subagents via the Task tool. Subagent definitions live in `/.claude/agents/`:

| Subagent | File | Invoked when | Verdict triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fullstack Engineer | `fullstack-developer.md` | Story is `todo` or `in_progress` | → `review` (or → `blocked`) |
| Code Reviewer | `code-reviewer.md` | Story is `review` | → `testing` or → `in_progress` |
| QA Expert | `qa-expert.md` | Story is `testing` | → `done` or → `in_progress` |
| Debugger | `debugger.md` | On demand (test failures, hard bugs) | n/a |
| Security Auditor | `security-auditor.md` | On demand (security-sensitive stories) | n/a |

Subagents report structured verdicts. The **orchestrator** writes all status changes, CHANGELOG updates, commits, and merges.

### 2.1 Invoking subagents

Use the Task tool to invoke a subagent. Pass the subagent's prompt (from its `.md` file) along with the story context (ID, acceptance criteria, branch name, and any review feedback). The subagent works within the current repository state and returns a structured result.

### 2.2 Subagent model selection

- **Fullstack Engineer**: Use `sonnet` model for implementation speed
- **Code Reviewer**: Use `opus` model for thorough review
- **QA Expert**: Use `sonnet` model for test execution
- **Debugger**: Use `sonnet` model for diagnosis
- **Security Auditor**: Use `opus` model for thorough analysis

## 3) Selecting work

The orchestrator must process stories in this priority order:

### 3.1 Priority: finish in-flight work first

1. **Review queue**: Find stories with `status: review`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the code reviewer.
2. **Testing queue**: Find stories with `status: testing`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the QA expert.
3. **In-progress stories with feedback**: Find stories with `status: in_progress` AND a non-empty `review_feedback`. Process the highest priority one by invoking the fullstack engineer to address the feedback.
4. **New work**: Select a new story using the algorithm below.

### 3.2 New work selection algorithm (deterministic)

1) Filter stories with `status: todo`.
2) Exclude stories that are `blocked` (blocked=true or blocked_reason present).
3) Exclude stories whose `requires` list contains any story that does not have `status: done`.
4) **Bugs first**: Partition eligible stories into bugs (id starts with `B-`) and non-bugs. If any bugs are eligible, select from bugs only.
5) Within the selected partition, choose the highest priority story (higher number = higher priority).
6) Tie-breaker: lowest id lexicographically.

If no eligible stories remain across all queues:
- Stop making changes and exit the cycle without modifying files.

## 4) Per-cycle workflow

The orchestrator performs these steps each cycle:

### 4.1 Feature Branch
- Work each story in its own feature branch (e.g. `S-123` for a story, `B-321` for a bug)
- If the story is already `in_progress`/`review`/`testing`, the branch should already exist — switch to it
- If a story becomes blocked, do not merge down the branch
- If the story reaches `done` and the user has approved it, merge the branch into `main` after committing

### 4.2 Check for requirements changes
- Inspect the git commit history (or working set) for changes to the /agent/PRD.md or answers provided in /agent/QUESTIONS.md

### 4.3 Dispatch to subagent

Based on the story's current status, invoke the appropriate subagent:

#### Story status: `todo` or `in_progress`
1. Set status to `in_progress` in backlog.yaml if currently `todo`
2. Invoke the **fullstack engineer** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Any `review_feedback` (if returning from review/QA)
   - Branch name
3. On success: set status to `review`, clear `review_feedback`
4. On failure/blocked: set status to `blocked` with `blocked_reason`

#### Story status: `review`
1. Invoke the **code reviewer** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Branch name (diff against main)
2. If approved: set status to `testing`
3. If changes requested: set status to `in_progress`, record feedback in `review_feedback`

#### Story status: `testing`
1. Invoke the **QA expert** subagent with:
   - Story ID, title, and acceptance criteria
   - Branch name
   - Code reviewer's approval notes (if any)
2. Parse the QA verdict for both the story result and runtime error sweep findings.
3. If approved: set status to `done`
4. If issues found: set status to `in_progress`, record feedback in `review_feedback`
5. After the story status transition, process any sweep findings per section 4.4.1.

### 4.4 Update artifacts (orchestrator responsibility)

After each subagent completes, the **orchestrator** (not the subagent) performs these updates:
- Update /agent/backlog.yaml with the new status and any feedback
- Are there questions that could help decide next steps? Update /agent/QUESTIONS.md and trigger a discord notification via the MCP tool. Also indicate questions in the chat output.
- **Process improvement ideas**: If the subagent's response includes a "Process Improvements" section, append each idea to the appropriate section in /agent/IDEAS.md (`## Features`, `## Dev Ops`, or `## Workflow`). Then send a discord notification:
  `[project] New ideas from <agent-name>: <title> — <brief description>, <title> — <brief description>.`

### 4.4.1 Processing QA runtime error sweep findings

When the QA expert's verdict includes a "Runtime Error Sweep" section with findings (sweep result: FINDINGS), the orchestrator processes them **after** the story status transition:

1. **New bug tickets**: For each bug ticket reported by QA:
   - Determine the next available `B-NNN` ID by scanning existing bug IDs in backlog.yaml.
   - Add the ticket to the `stories` list in /agent/backlog.yaml with:
     - `id`: Next sequential B-NNN
     - `title`: From QA's suggested title
     - `priority`: From QA's suggested priority (default: 70)
     - `status: todo`
     - `requires: []`
     - `acceptance`: From QA's suggested acceptance criteria
     - `testing`: From QA's suggested testing commands
     - `notes`: Include the log evidence and root cause hypothesis from the QA report

2. **Improvement ideas**: For each improvement idea reported by QA:
   - Append to /agent/IDEAS.md with the title and description.

3. **Discord notification**: If any bug tickets were filed, send a notification (see section 9.2).

4. **Timing**: Process sweep findings after the story status transition and before the commit. This ensures new backlog entries are included in the story's commit. If the story was REJECTED, sweep findings are still processed — they are independent of the story result.

5. **No sweep findings**: If sweep result is CLEAN or the section is absent, skip this step.

### 4.5 Finalization on QA approval (orchestrator responsibility)

When the QA expert reports **APPROVED**, the orchestrator performs these steps in order:

1. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add an entry to /CHANGELOG.md for the completed story. Include a token consumption summary line at the end of the entry (e.g., `- Token usage: <input_tokens> input, <output_tokens> output`). Use the cumulative token counts from the current conversation session (visible via `/cost` or session stats).
2. **Update backlog**: Set `status: done` in /agent/backlog.yaml.
3. **Commit**: Create the commit (per commit rules below).
4. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into `main` (per the commit/merge policy in PROMPT.md).

These finalization actions are exclusively owned by the orchestrator. No subagent may update CHANGELOG, commit, or merge.

### 4.6 Commit rules
Default: commit when a story reaches `done` and the user has reviewed the changes. Wait for review before committing.
- Create a single commit per story unless the story explicitly requires multiple commits.
- Commit message format:
    - `story(<id>): <title>`
- Do not add "Co-Authored-By" trailers or any other attribution lines to commit messages.
- The commit must include:
    - code changes
    - passing tests for primary acceptance criteria
    - backlog.yaml updates
    - changelog entry

## 5) Definition of Done (DoD)

A story may be set to `status: done` only if all are true:

**Verified by subagents (before QA approval):**
1) All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
2) Required tests are present and meaningful.
3) All relevant test suites pass locally.
4) Lint/typecheck passes where applicable (per story scope).
5) Code review passed (story went through `review` → `testing` transition).
6) QA testing passed (QA expert reports APPROVED).
7) No scope violations:
    - no generated code edits in internal/api/gen or **/mocks or inside node_modules or any other generated/external code
    - no unofficial workarounds for stubbed features
    - no secrets added to repo or logs

**Performed by the orchestrator (after QA approval):**
8) /CHANGELOG.md updated with the story entry.
9) Work committed with correct message format (unless story explicitly overrides).
10) Feature branch merged to main (per commit/merge policy in PROMPT.md).

## 6) Blocking rules

A story is BLOCKED when:
- A required dependency is missing (e.g., unresolved design decision, missing schema detail) AND
- Progress cannot continue without inventing requirements or violating PRD.

When blocked:
- Set `status: blocked`.
- Record blocked_reason with:
    - what is blocked
    - why it is blocked
    - what decision/input is needed
- Update /agent/IDEAS.md with ideas for features that could enhance the application
- Update /agent/backlog.yaml if stories now require each other in a new way

## 7) Safety gates

At all times:
- Respect CLAUDE.md safe-command policy.
- Never log secrets.
- Never modify infra/deploy/security-sensitive files unless the story explicitly requires it.

## 8) Stopping conditions

End the cycle when any occurs:
- The selected story reaches `done` and is committed.
- The selected story becomes `blocked` and backlog.yaml is updated accordingly.
- No eligible stories remain across any queue.
- A hard failure prevents continuing safely (e.g., irreconcilable test failures); record a blocker note and stop.

## 9) Discord notifications

If the `send_discord_notification` MCP tool is available, use it to notify the user on every status transition and at key workflow points.

### 9.1 Message format

Every message MUST start with the project name in brackets: `[project-name]`. The project name comes from the `project` field in backlog.yaml.

Example: `[checkpoint-sampler] S-028: todo → in_progress. Starting XY grid corner-based cell resizing.`

### 9.2 Status transition notifications

Send a notification on every story status change:

- **todo → in_progress**: `[project] <id>: todo → in_progress. Starting: <title>.`
- **in_progress → review**: `[project] <id>: in_progress → review. Implementation complete: <brief summary of what changed>.`
- **in_progress → blocked**: `[project] <id>: in_progress → blocked. <blocked_reason>.`
- **review → testing**: `[project] <id>: review → testing. Code review approved.`
- **review → in_progress**: `[project] <id>: review → in_progress. Changes requested: <1-2 sentence summary of feedback>.`
- **testing → done**: `[project] <id>: testing → done. QA approved. <title> is complete. Tokens: <input_tokens>in / <output_tokens>out.`
- **testing → in_progress**: `[project] <id>: testing → in_progress. QA found issues: <1-2 sentence summary of feedback>.`

When a story is returned to `in_progress` (from review or testing), always include a concise summary of the feedback so the user understands what went wrong without needing to check the repo.

- **QA sweep findings**: `[project] QA sweep: filed <N> new ticket(s): <B-NNN> (<title> — <1-2 sentence description>), <B-NNN> (<title> — <1-2 sentence description>). See backlog.yaml.`
  - Sent only when the QA sweep produced new bug tickets (not for improvement ideas alone).
  - Sent immediately after the story status notification.

### 9.3 Other notifications

- **Input needed**: Before displaying a claude permission request. `[project] Input needed — waiting for approval.`
- **Story merged down**: If running in non-interactive mode, when committing and merging. `[project] <id>: Committed and merged to main.`
- **Cycle ending with no work**: When no eligible stories remain. `[project] No eligible stories — backlog is empty or fully blocked.`

### 9.4 Rules

- Keep messages concise (1-3 sentences).
- Do not include secrets, file paths, or code in notifications.
- If the tool is unavailable or fails, continue normally — notifications are best-effort and must not block the workflow.

## 10) Token tracking

When a story reaches `done`, the orchestrator must record the cumulative token consumption for the current conversation session. This provides cost visibility per story.

### 10.1 How to obtain token counts

Run `/cost` in the Claude Code session to get the current session's token usage. Extract the input and output token counts.

### 10.2 Where to record

1. **Discord notification** (section 9.2): Append `Tokens: <input>in / <output>out.` to the `testing → done` message.
2. **CHANGELOG entry** (section 4.5): Add a `- Token usage: <input> input, <output> output` line at the end of the story's changelog entry.

### 10.3 Notes

- Token counts reflect the full conversation session, which may include multiple subagent invocations and retry loops for a single story.
- If a story spans multiple ralph cycles (e.g., review rejection → re-implementation), only the final cycle's tokens are recorded (prior cycles' context is lost).
- If token counts cannot be obtained (e.g., `/cost` unavailable), omit the token line rather than guessing.

## 11) Ralph loop expectations

The agent must assume:
- Context is cleared between cycles.
- The only persisted state is the repository content and git history.
- Therefore, always re-read the input files in section 0 before acting.
- A single cycle may advance a story through multiple status transitions (e.g., `todo` → `in_progress` → `review` → `testing` → `done`) if all subagents complete successfully within the cycle.
