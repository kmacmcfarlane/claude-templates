    acceptance:
      - "docs/ contains architecture.md, database.md, and api.md outlining architectural approach for the project"
      - "CLAUDE.md is updated so future iterations are aware of the new docs if they need to reference them"
      - "architecture.md should cover general architecture for the frontend and backend"
      - "database.md should outline a complete DB schema"
      - "api.md should cover general approach to the API design. NOTE: /internal/api/design is the source-of-truth for the API layout, so don't be overly specific about each endpoint/payload/response in api.md"
    testing:
      - "command: (n/a) file presence and structure only"
      - "review the changes thoroughly and iterate as necessary"
