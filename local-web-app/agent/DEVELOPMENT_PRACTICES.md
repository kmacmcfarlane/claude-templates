# DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md 

This document defines engineering standards for the project. These practices apply to every story unless explicitly overridden in /agent/backlog.yaml.

## 1) Principles

### 1.1 Local-first, portable, reproducible
- Everything runs on Linux via Docker for portability.
- `make up` runs the operational stack.
- `make up-dev` runs hot reload + watch tests.
- Developer experience is a first-class requirement; do not break watch workflows.

### 1.2 Separation of concerns is mandatory
- UI concerns live in frontend.
- Business logic lives in backend service layer.
- Persistence and external integrations live in backend store layer.
- Domain model lives in backend model layer.
- File format definitions (if needed) live in a dedicated backend layer.
- Transport glue lives in backend API layer.
- Generated code is never modified manually.

### 1.3 Domain model is internal-only
- Types in `internal/model/` are the canonical domain representation used by service and store layers.
- Model types must NOT carry serialization tags (json, xml, etc.) — they are not external types.
- External boundaries must define their own types tailored to their needs:
    - **API request/response**: Goa-generated types in `internal/api/gen/` (auto-generated from design).
    - **File storage formats**: Dedicated types in `internal/fileformat/` with appropriate json struct tags.
    - **DB entities**: Persistence representations in `internal/store/` (mapped to/from model).
- Each external type package provides mapper functions to convert to/from `model` types.
- This keeps coupling low: changes to a file format, API shape, or DB schema do not leak into business logic.

### 1.4 Explicit contracts
- Prefer interfaces at module boundaries.
- Keep stable, testable contracts for:
    - stores (DB access)
    - providers (channels)
    - crypto/auth primitives
    - API client wrappers (frontend)

### 1.5 Security by construction
- No secrets in logs.
- Credentials encrypted at rest.
- Tests never send real messages.
- Stubs for unsupported mediums remain stubs unless PRD changes.

## 2) Repository structure and boundaries

### 2.1 Root
- Root Makefile orchestrates:
    - operational compose (`make up`)
    - dev compose overlays (`make up-dev`)
    - watch tests (`make test-frontend-watch`, `make test-backend-watch`)
- Root compose files define:
    - operational mode
    - dev overlays (hot reload + test watch)

### 2.2 Backend structure (strict)
Within `/backend`:
- `cmd/`  entrypoints only; wiring, flags, env; no business logic.
- `internal/model/`  domain structs and domain-level helpers.
- `internal/service/`  business logic; depends on model and interfaces.
- `internal/store/`  persistence and external resources (DB, providers, filesystem). Define DB entities here (not in model).
- `internal/fileformat/`  external file format types (if needed) with json tags; mappers to/from model.
- `internal/api/`  Goa design, transport, swagger hosting; glue.
- `internal/api/gen/`  generated; do not edit.
- `pkg/`  only for deliberately shared code; default is to avoid.

### 2.3 Frontend structure (recommended)
Within `/frontend`:
- `src/api/`  backend API client module(s) (single abstraction point).
- `src/components/`  UI components (presentational).
- `src/views/`  route-level pages.
- `src/stores/`  state management (if used).
- `src/lib/`  shared utilities (markdown rendering, formatting).
- `src/types/`  shared TS types (or `src/api/types`).

## 3) Backend (Go) practices

### 3.1 Coding style
- Prefer small packages with clear responsibilities.
- Avoid `init()` for anything beyond trivial registration.
- Prefer explicit constructor functions:
    - `NewX(deps ...) *X`
- Use `context.Context` as first parameter for request-scoped operations.
- Return typed errors with stable codes for UI mapping.

### 3.2 Error handling
- Errors must carry:
    - a stable error code (string)
    - a safe, user-facing message (optional, sanitized)
    - an internal message for logs (optional, sanitized)
- Avoid string-matching errors in calling code; use typed errors or sentinel codes.

### 3.3 Interfaces and dependency injection
- Define interfaces in the consumer package:
    - service depends on store/provider interfaces defined near the service.
- Store layer implements persistence interfaces.
- Provider interfaces for external integrations:
    - Stub providers must return explicit NotImplemented codes.

### 3.4 Concurrency
- Prefer bounded worker pools over unbounded goroutines.
- Concurrency must not break log correctness or deterministic ordering requirements.

### 3.5 Database and migrations
- Migrations are applied on startup.
- Treat schema changes as backward-compatible when possible; add migrations rather than destructive changes.

### 3.6 Secrets
- Never log passwords, tokens, authorization headers, or raw responses that contain secrets.
- Credential storage and authentication details are defined in the PRD.

### 3.7 Goa usage
- All API shapes defined in `internal/api/design`.
- Generated output goes to `internal/api/gen`.
- Do not hand-edit generated files.
- Host swagger UI at `/docs` with `openapi3.json` served.

### 3.8 Mocking
- Use mockery for interfaces.
- Keep mocks in predictable package(s) (e.g., `serviceMocks`, `storeMocks`).
- Ensure codegen ordering when types are generated (Goa before mocks).

### 3.9 Build and lint
- Backend Makefile provides:
    - `gen`, `build`, `lint`, `test`, `run`
- Linting must be consistent and enforced.
- Prefer `go fmt` / `goimports` and standard tooling.

## 4) Frontend (TypeScript + Vue) practices

### 4.1 TypeScript rigor
- Enable strict TypeScript settings.
- Avoid `any`; use unknown and narrow properly.
- Prefer explicit types at module boundaries, inferred types within modules.
- Keep backend API types centralized in the API client module.

### 4.2 API client isolation
- All backend calls go through `src/api/*`.
- UI components should not construct fetch requests directly.
- Normalize error responses into a stable UI error shape.

### 4.3 State management
- Keep state minimal and localized.
- If using a global store, treat it as a thin cache and workflow coordinator.
- Avoid duplicating server state across multiple stores.

### 4.4 UI composition
- Components:
    - Prefer small, reusable presentational components.
    - Route views handle orchestration and data loading.
- Forms:
    - Prefer consistent validation patterns.
    - Show errors derived from stable backend error codes.

### 4.5 Testing and dev experience
- Vitest watch is mandatory for dev workflow:
    - `npm run test:watch`
- Keep tests fast enough for constant feedback.
- Avoid brittle snapshots; prefer behavioral assertions.

### 4.6 Lint and format
- Enforce linting and formatting consistently (ESLint/Prettier or equivalent).
- No formatting churn unrelated to a story.

## 5) Docker and dev workflow practices

### 5.0 Environment detection
Before running build/test commands, detect whether the agent is inside a Docker container by checking for `/.dockerenv`. This determines the correct way to invoke tools:
- **Inside container**: Go is not available; use `docker compose ... run --rm backend sh -c "..."` for Go commands. Node.js/npm/npx are available directly.
- **On host**: Check for native tool availability (`which go`, etc.) and use them directly when present. Fall back to compose if not.

See CLAUDE.md section 6 for full details.

### 5.1 Operational mode (`make up`)
- Runs the application in a stable configuration:
    - built assets or production-like server mode
    - persistent data volume

### 5.2 Dev mode (`make up-dev`)
- Runs:
    - frontend dev server with HMR
    - backend with hot reload (air)
    - watch tests for both stacks
- Source code mounted into containers for live editing.
- Persistent artifacts mounted:
    - database file (or directory)
    - optional config YAML (if introduced)

### 5.3 Make targets (contract)
Root Makefile must provide:
- `up`, `down`, `logs`
- `up-dev`
- `test-frontend` (one-shot `npm run test` in docker)
- `test-frontend-watch` (runs `npm run test:watch` in docker)
- `test-backend` (one-shot `ginkgo -r` in docker; race + cover where feasible)
- `test-backend-watch` (runs `ginkgo watch` in docker; race where feasible)

Do not change these targets without updating PRD/backlog and related docs.

### 5.4 Agent vs human workflows
Watch mode (`test-backend-watch`, `test-frontend-watch`) is designed for human developers who monitor a terminal continuously. Agents cannot use watch mode because it is a long-running process that never exits — agents need discrete pass/fail results per tool invocation.

**Agent workflow:**
- Use one-shot targets: `make test-backend`, `make test-frontend`
- After Goa DSL edits: run codegen (via compose or direct `make gen`), then `make test-backend`
- Frontend: `make test-frontend` or `cd frontend && npx vitest run`

**Human workflow:**
- Use watch targets: `make test-backend-watch`, `make test-frontend-watch`
- After Goa DSL edits: run `make gen`, watch output auto-reruns

## 6) Documentation and hygiene

### 6.1 Agent docs
- /agent/PRD.md is the product source of truth.
- /agent/backlog.yaml is the only work queue.
- /agent/AGENT_FLOW.md is the process contract.
- /agent/TEST_PRACTICES.md and /agent/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md define standards.

### 6.2 Changelog
- /CHANGELOG.md updated per completed story.
- Keep entries concise and user-visible.

### 6.3 README
- /README.md is the public-facing project overview and quick-start guide.
- Update it when a completed story changes any of the following:
    - Features or capabilities (new channels, UI sections, major behaviours).
    - Tech stack (new runtime, framework, or infrastructure dependency).
    - Project structure (new top-level directories or significant layout changes).
    - Configuration (new environment variables or default values).
    - Quick-start or development workflow commands.
    - Security model (authentication, encryption, or session changes).
- Keep the README concise and factual — it is not a changelog. Reference /CHANGELOG.md for detailed per-story history.
- Do not duplicate information already covered in /docs/ or /agent/; link to those files instead.

### 6.4 Git hygiene
- Small, reviewable commits.
- One story per commit unless story explicitly requires more.
- Commit message format: `story(<id>): <title>`.

## 7) Out of scope enforcement
- Features marked as stubs in the PRD remain stubs until PRD/backlog explicitly changes.
- No unofficial scraping/spoofing/reverse-engineered APIs.
